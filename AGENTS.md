# Pleiades

A notlob literate programming project.

## Getting oriented

Run `notlob docs` to write the language reference to `notlob-docs/LANGUAGE.md`.

Read `notlob-docs/LANGUAGE.md` for syntax, claims, and project structure.

## Key commands

```
notlob test                       run all claims in the project
notlob build                      assemble modules to dist/
notlob run <file>                 execute a module
notlob weave                      render project as Markdown
notlob new <name>                 create a new module
notlob docs                       write language reference to notlob-docs/
notlob check                      check naming consistency and imports
notlob graph                      export the name-graph for the entire project
notlob query search <pattern>     find nodes by label
notlob query content <address>    show source at an address
notlob query children <address>   list child nodes
```

## Project structure

`binding.lob` is the project manifest (language, tooling). Source modules are `*.lob` files — each combines prose, code, and claims. `notlob-docs/` holds generated reference docs and is not checked in.

## Source of Truth

`.lob` files are the source of truth for this project. **Never create or edit generated files directly** — `dist/` is produced by `notlob build`, `notlob-docs/` by `notlob docs`, and assembled source written with `--keep-generated-src` is for debugging only.

When investigating a behaviour or debugging a test, read the `.lob` source first. Use `--keep-generated-src` only when you need to inspect the assembled executable form. Any change you want to make must be made in the corresponding `.lob` file.

## Semantic Checks

`notlob check` analyses the name graph for consistency. It runs automatically during `notlob test` and `notlob build` (project-wide).

Checks such as unused imports will error and stop the build. However, most checks are informational only, but intended as guidance to allow the programmer to reflect on the design and code quality. It gives information that help indicate whether names and code reinforce each other, and whether there is the right amount of test coverage. 

## Style Guidance

Notlob source files should be written in a literate programming style. Each file is organised around a concept. An initial short essay should introduce the purpose. Executable code, executable examples and runnable properties should be interleaved with clear technical prose. Tests are not only encouraged but expected, and a linter runs by default.

## Command Guidance

Notlob has specific features which make it easier to search for concepts in documentation and code. Use `notlob graph` to get a project-level overview of a notlob project. Favour using `notlob query` over filesystem searches to navigate for the meaning of names and use of symbols throughout the codebase.
